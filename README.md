# SAS-Titanic
Using SAS for data and risk analysis.
A project from The infinite actuaries technical skills course.
The aim of this project is to use a subset of the greater data set for passengers on the Titanic within SAS to study different factors affecting the survival rate of the passengers

In its current form, the merge of of TitanicWork and PortNames does not function properly because it does not properly append the PortName column onto the new data set.

The code for the subset of data and its importation is contained in "Titanic_SAS_Code.txt"
The code for the data analysis and construction of the linear regression model within SAS are in file "TITANIC_SAS_Project.txt"
A summary of the analysis is contained within file "Summary of Titanic analysis.docx"
